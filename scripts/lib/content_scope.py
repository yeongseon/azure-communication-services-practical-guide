"""Shared scope policy for ``content_validation`` enforcement (ACS).

Defines which markdown files in ``docs/`` are required to carry the
``content_validation:`` frontmatter block (factual-claim pages) versus those
that are out of scope (navigation indexes, KQL packs, SDK guides, reference
look-ups, visualization pages, meta, contributing, start-here, and other
non-claim content).

**Wave 0 status (ACS)**: this module is ported but not yet imported by any
consumer script. ACS has not adopted the ``content_validation`` frontmatter
block yet. The module is present for future compatibility and to document
the policy contract for ACS.

Imported by (future):

- ``scripts/generate_content_validation_status.py`` (if ACS adopts it)
- ``scripts/remove_tautological_validation.py`` (if ACS adopts it)

The policy MUST stay in sync with ``AGENTS.md`` §Text Content Validation
(when ACS's ``AGENTS.md`` adopts one). If you change the rules here, update
``AGENTS.md`` in the same commit.

**Adaptations from the azure-container-apps-practical-guide reference:**

- ``troubleshooting/lab-guides/`` is retained in ``EXCLUDED_SUBPATHS`` as a
  placeholder even though ACS does not currently have that subdirectory.
  Retaining the exclusion keeps the ported module byte-close to the
  container-apps reference and makes future adoption of methodology labs
  a zero-code change.
- Doctest examples use ACS section names (``sdk-guides``, ``visualization``,
  ``meta``, ``contributing``, ``about.md``) rather than the container-apps
  section names (``language-guides``).
